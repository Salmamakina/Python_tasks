TASK 5
 DICE ROLLING SIMULATOR
 ● Create a simple Python program that simulates rolling dice. Users can specify the 
number of sides on the dice and the number of rolls. 
● The program generates random numbers for each roll and displays the results. 
● It's a quick and fun way to emulate the experience of rolling dice, commonly used 
in board games or tabletop role-playing games. 
● The simulator allows users to explore the outcomes of dice rolls without the 
physical dice.
